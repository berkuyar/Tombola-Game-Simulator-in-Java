# **Tombola (Bingo) Game Simulator**

## **Project Description**
This project is a **dynamic console-based Tombola (Bingo) simulator** developed using **Java and Eclipse**.  
It reads player and card data from `Bilgiler.txt`, then simulates a game where random numbers are drawn every **0.5 seconds** until a winner emerges. The game dynamically updates and marks drawn numbers, following the rules:  

✅ **Each card has 5 unique numbers from 1 to 20**  
✅ **Numbers are drawn randomly every 0.5 seconds**  
✅ **If a drawn number exists on a card, it is marked with `#`**  
✅ **The game ends when one or more players complete their cards**  

The project follows **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** and utilizes **data structures** for efficiency.
